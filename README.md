I created a blog API project in Express.js with an MVC structure. The project includes CRUD operations for blog categories, artists, and blog content, featuring multer file uploads for content images. Admin can create blog categories, and artists can create blogs for specific categories. Password Secure with Bcrypt. Time-Management with Moment.js. All operations are secured with token authentication.
